# Scratch-Unix
A place to host my own builds of Scratch for various Unix OSes that Scratch does not support

OSes supported in these builds:
- Apple Silicon macOS
- AMD64 Linux
- ARM64 Linux

Note:
If you want to download the source code, download the source-code.zip from the release you need because there are a lot of large files in the source code.
